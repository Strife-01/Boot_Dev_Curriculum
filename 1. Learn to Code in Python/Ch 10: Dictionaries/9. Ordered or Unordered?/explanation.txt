Unordered

Python uses 2 arrays dk_indices and dk_entries
dk_indices hasindex for the hash index in the dk_entries
we compute the hash of the key to get the index in the dk_indices and that will give us the index for the dk_entries which contains hash, key, entry

and dk_entries is the one that is always ordered and the one that we parse with a for loop to get the entries in the same order
