Bubble sort repeatedly steps through a slice and compares adjacent elements, swapping them if they are out of order. It continues to loop over the slice until the whole list is completely sorted. Here's the pseudocode:

    Set swapping to True
    Set end to the length of the input list
    While swapping is True:
        Set swapping to False
        For i from the 2nd element to end:
            If the (i-1)th element of the input list is greater than the ith element:
                Swap the (i-1)th element and the ith element
                Set swapping to True
        Decrement end by one
    Return the sorted list
