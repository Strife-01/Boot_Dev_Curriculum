An "inorder" traversal is the most intuitive way to visit all the nodes in a tree. It's called "inorder" because the current node is visited between its children. It results in an ordered list of the nodes in the tree. The following tree:

    > 7
        > 6
> 4
    > 2
        > 1

Would be visited in this order:

[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
