Trees are like linked lists but instead of having one next node, each node has a list of children


    Each node has a value and a list of "children"
    Children can only have a single "parent"

Linked List:
node -> node -> node

Tree:
            > node
      > node
            > node
> node
            > node
      > node
            > node

1. True
2. multiple, one
