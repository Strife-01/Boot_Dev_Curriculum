A "preorder" traversal is a way to visit all the nodes in a tree. It's called "preorder" because the current node is visited before its children. This tree:

    > 7
        > 6
> 4
    > 2
        > 1

Would be traversed in this order:

[4, 2, 1, 7, 6]

Sometimes it's useful (albeit a bit slow) to iterate over all the nodes in the tree. In the case of LockedIn, we've been asked to build a way to create a backup of our database indexes - this traversal will allow us to save all the data in the tree to a file.

It is done recursively.
