The building blocks of a BST are Nodes. In our implementation, we will only use a single class, the BSTNode class. Any BSTNode is technically also a full Binary Search Tree, with itself as the root node (its not aware of any potential parents). All our methods that traverse the tree will do so recursively... have fun! /s
