The delete method is O(log(n)) because, just like most B-tree operations, we don't have to search the entire tree. We only have to search one path from the root to the leaf node we want to delete.

The depth of the tree on average is equal to log base 2 of the number of nodes in the tree. For example:
Nodes 	Depth
1 	0
2 	1
4 	2
8 	3
16 	4
32 	5
64 	6
128 	7
256 	8
512 	9
1024 	10
2048 	11
4096 	12

We only need to use ~10 steps to delete a node from a tree of ~1000 nodes.
