A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

    -- Wikipedia Definition

In other words, a data structure:

    Stores data
    Organizes data so that it can easily be accessed and modified
    Contains algorithmic functions to expose the ability to read and modify the data

You're already familiar with some of Python's built-in, simple data structures:

List: An ordered collection of items

animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']

Dictionary: Collections of key/value pairs

car = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
