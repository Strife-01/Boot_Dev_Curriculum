Properties

    Graphs can have any number of vertices.
    An undirected graph can have up to n(n - 1)/2 edges for n vertices.
    Vertices can exist without edges but may be disconnected (and thus kinda useless)
    Typically graphs (with the exception of multigraphs) can only have a single edge between two vertices
    Weighted graphs assign values (costs) to edges (we'll cover this in a future course)

1. False
2. n(n - 1)/2 - Slightly less than half of n^2 where n is the number of vertices
3. 1,3,6
