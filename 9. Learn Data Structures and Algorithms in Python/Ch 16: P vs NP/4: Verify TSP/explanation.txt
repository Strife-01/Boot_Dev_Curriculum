TSP takes factorial time to solve because we're forced to try every permutation of all the possible cities. For example, given 4 cities, A, B, C, D, we need to try:

A,B,C,D
B,A,C,D
C,A,B,D
A,C,B,D
B,C,A,D
C,B,A,D
C,B,D,A
B,C,D,A
D,C,B,A
C,D,B,A
B,D,C,A
D,B,C,A
D,A,C,B
A,D,C,B
C,D,A,B
D,C,A,B
A,C,D,B
C,A,D,B
B,A,D,C
A,B,D,C
D,B,A,C
B,D,A,C
A,D,B,C
D,A,B,C

That's 4! or 4*3*2*1 or 24 permutations.
TSP in NP

Although it takes factorial time to solve TSP, TSP is in NP because we can verify a solution much faster. Let's write a TSP verifier!
