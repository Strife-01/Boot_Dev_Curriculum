O(n) is very common - When the number of steps in an algorithm grows at the same rate as its input size, it's classified as O(n)

Input size 	Time to run
find_min(10 items) 	2 ms

Then we can estimate the following:
Input size 	Time to run
find_min(100 items) 	20 ms
find_min(1000 items) 	200 ms
find_min(10000 items) 	2000 ms
