    All supported operations are O(1) by themselves. However, some tasks, like getting to an item at the bottom of the stack have a higher time complexity because they require multiple pop operations.
    Stack operations are limited: no searching, no sorting, no random access
    Stacks, like all abstract data types, can store items of any type. What makes it a stack is the behavior of the operations, not the type of data it stores.
    Stacks are often used in the real world for:
        Function call management
        Undo/redo functionality
        Expression evaluation

1. Any of Them
2. O(n), because all other items need to be popped first
