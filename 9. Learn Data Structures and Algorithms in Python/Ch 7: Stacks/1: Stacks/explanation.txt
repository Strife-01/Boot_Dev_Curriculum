It's called a "stack" because it behaves just like a stack of physical items. Imagine a stack of plates: it's easy to take an item off the top of the stack, but you can't really get to the items in the middle or at the bottom without removing the items on top first. You'll often hear a stack referred to as a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.
