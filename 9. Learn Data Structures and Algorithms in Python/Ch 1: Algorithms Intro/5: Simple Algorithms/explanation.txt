Algorithms, like anything else, can be understood by breaking them down piece by piece. Take a look at the following algorithm for adding two numbers--it's dead simple:

    Start with input variables a and b
    Add a and b using the + operator, and assign the result to a new variable, sum
    Return the sum variable
