Goals of This Course

    Learn to think about how to organize data for more efficient access. Break problems down into data models that make sense.
    Learn and practice performance optimization. Make your code run faster and more efficiently, even with more data.
    Practice solving hard problems. There's no way around it, if you want to be a great developer, you need to solve hard problems.

What Is a Data Structure?

Data structures are just organizational tools that allow for more advanced algorithms. You're already familiar with some of the simplest data structures:

    Lists: Ordered collections of data
    Dictionaries: Key -> value mappings
    Sets: Unordered collections of unique data

In this course we'll be exploring when you should use each of these, but we'll also cover more advanced structures like stacks, queues, and trees.
    Learn to think algorithmically. Break problems down into easier to solve parts.
    Learn about performance optimization. Make your code run faster and more efficiently, even with more data.
    Practice solving hard problems. There's no way around it, if you want to be a great developer, you need to solve hard problems.
