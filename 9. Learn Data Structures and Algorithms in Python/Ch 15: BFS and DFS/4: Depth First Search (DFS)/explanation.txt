Depth-first search (DFS) is just another algorithm to traverse a graph - kind of like breadth first search. It starts at a root node (some arbitrary node on the graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking and starting down the next branch.


Goes deep until it cannot anymore
it uses a stack instead of a queue
