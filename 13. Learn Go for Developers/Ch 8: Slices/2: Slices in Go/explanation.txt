slices are dinamically sized cause it has an underlying array behind it
the zero value of a slice is nil

arrayname[lowIndex:highIndex]
arrayname[lowIndex:]
arrayname[:highIndex]
arrayname[:]

lowIndex inclusive
highIndex exclusive


primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
mySlice := primes[1:4]
// mySlice = {3, 5, 7}

make a slice from an array
