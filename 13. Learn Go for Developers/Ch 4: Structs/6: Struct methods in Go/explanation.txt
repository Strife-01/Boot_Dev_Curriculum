In go we can attach reciver functions to any data types created with type
they can be structs or other types we declare
and we can create interfaces that our structs can implement and these will be attached to our receivers
receivers by convention are a variable of type type created that we name with the first letter of the type (just convention)


type rect struct {
  width int
  height int
}

// area has a receiver of (r rect)
// rect is the struct
// r is the placeholder
func (r rect) area() int {
  return r.width * r.height
}

var r = rect{
  width: 5,
  height: 10,
}

fmt.Println(r.area())
// prints 50
