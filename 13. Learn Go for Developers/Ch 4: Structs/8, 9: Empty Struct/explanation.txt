// anonymous empty struct type

The cool thing about empty structs is that they're the smallest possible type in Go: they take up zero bytes of memory.

Later in this course, you'll see how and when they're used: it's surprisingly often! Mostly with maps and channels.

'struct{}' is the type (empty struct) and '{}' is the value (empty struct literal)
