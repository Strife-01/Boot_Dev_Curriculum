in go every function is a first class function and a higher order function
we can have a function assigned to a variable and that variable is going to be of function type
but we can also provide a function as an argument to another function and call it inside the function


func aggregate(a, b, c int, arithmetic func(int, int) int) int {
  firstResult := arithmetic(a, b)
  secondResult := arithmetic(firstResult, c)
  return secondResult
}
