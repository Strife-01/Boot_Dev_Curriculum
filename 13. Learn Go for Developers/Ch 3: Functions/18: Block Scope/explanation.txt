go is not like python function scoped
go is block scoped and we can use non attached scopes
package main

func main() {
    {
        age := 19
        // this is okay
        fmt.Println(age)
    }

    // this is not okay
    // the age variable is out of scope
    fmt.Println(age)
}

Blocks are defined by curly braces {}. New blocks are created for:

    Functions
    Loops
    If statements
    Switch statements
    Select statements
    Explicit blocks
