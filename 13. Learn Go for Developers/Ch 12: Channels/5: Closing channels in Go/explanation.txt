ch := make(chan int)

// do some stuff with the channel

close(ch)


v, ok := <-ch
if ok is false than the channel is closed and empty

don't send data to a closed channel or the main goroutine will crash
open not used goroutines will be garbage collected

a panic in the main goroutine will cause the whole program to crash
a panic in the other goroutines will cause those to crash
