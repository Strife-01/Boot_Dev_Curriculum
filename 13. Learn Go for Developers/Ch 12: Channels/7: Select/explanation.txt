the select is like switch but for channels
if we have a goroutine listening to multiple channels at the same time we can use a select
statement and it will choose the first channel that gets populated 

select {
case i, ok := <- chInts:
    fmt.Println(i)
case s, ok := <- chStrings:
    fmt.Println(s)
}

the ok tells us if the channel is active or closed
