a module is a collection of packages that are released together

hellogo:
  - main package
  - library package 1
  - library package 2


usually we have 1 module per repository:
at the root of the module we have a file called go.mod
this file contains:

    The module path
    The version of the Go language your project requires
    Optionally, any external package dependencies your project has

ex of go.mod

module github.com/bootdotdev/exampleproject - import path for all the packages in that module

go 1.23.0

require github.com/google/examplepackage v1.3.0

An "import path" is a string used to import a package. A package's import path is its module path joined with its subdirectory within the module. For example, the module github.com/google/go-cmp contains a package in the directory cmp/. That package's import path is github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp. Packages in the standard library do not have a module path prefix.
