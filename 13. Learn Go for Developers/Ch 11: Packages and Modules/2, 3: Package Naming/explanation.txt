by convention the packages are named as the last package in their relative path
ex
import math/rand will have files with the first line package rand
these files are in the same directory - that directory is the package

all the files in a package must be in the same directory otherwise there will be an error

package math and this contains package rand

the names are not required to match their import path but it is discorraged for consistency

a directory of go has at most 1 package and all .go files in the same directory must belong to the same package
