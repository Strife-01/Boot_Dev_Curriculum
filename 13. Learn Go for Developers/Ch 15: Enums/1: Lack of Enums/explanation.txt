go doesn't have:

sum types:  a variable that can be either on type or other type
  - tagged unions - amazing in haskell and other functional programming languages
  - discriminated unions
  - algebraic data types ADT
unions: "A struct where you only have one element of the how many are presented"
enums: GO DOESN'T HAVE ENUMS???

in go, like in rust, erros are just values
well, you have panic/recover for threads but you should avoid using it


user, err := getUser()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to get user: %w", err)
}
// do something with user

let user_result = get_user();
let user = match user_result {
    Ok(user) => user,
    Err(error) => return Err(format!("failed to get user: {}", error)),
};
