generics are used to make the code reusable for other data structures or types

usually used in libraries and packages because they are importable

go is simple and it doesn't have a lot of abstractions cause it wants to be very simplistic 

go lacks a lot of features but it has what it needs to be very fast to work with and to run 

it added generics cause they make way easier reusable code
