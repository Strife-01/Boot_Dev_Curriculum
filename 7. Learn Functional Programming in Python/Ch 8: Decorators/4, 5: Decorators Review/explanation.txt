A Python decorator is just syntactic sugar for higher-order functions. "Syntactic sugar" just means "a more convenient syntax".

Not all programming languages have built-in decorators, but most do support higher-order functions and closures.

Some of the famous functional languages like:

    Haskell
    Erlang
    Clojure
    Lisp

do not have special syntax decorators, but they do have higher-order functions and closures, meaning the decorator pattern can still be used. So, if you understand those concepts, they will serve you well in many different languages.
