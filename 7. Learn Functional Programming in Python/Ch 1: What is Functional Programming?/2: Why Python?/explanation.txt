Frankly, Python is not the best language for functional programming. Reasons include:

    No static typing.
    Everything is mutable.
    No tail call optimization.
    Side effects are common.
    Imperative and OOP styles abound in popular libraries.
    Purity is not enforced (and sometimes not even encouraged).
    Sum Types are hard to define.
    Pattern matching is weak at best.

functional languages:
    Haskell
    OCaml
    Elixir
