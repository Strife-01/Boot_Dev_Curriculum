Functional programming tends to be more popular amongst us mathematicions 
avg = Σx/N

To put this calculation in plain English:

    Σ is just the Greek letter Sigma, and it represents "the sum of a collection".
    x is the collection of numbers we're averaging.
    N is the number of elements in the collection.
    avg is equal to the sum of all the numbers in collection "x" divided by the number of elements in collection "x".


Imperative:
def get_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total / len(nums)

Declarative:
def get_average(nums):
    return sum(nums) / len(nums)


In information technology and computer science, a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions;[1] the remembered information is called the state of the system.

The set of states a system can occupy is known as its state space.

We don't keep track of the state of the variables in functional. In Imperative we do OOP.
