    Return the same result if given the same arguments. They are deterministic.
    Do not change the external state of the program. For example, they do not change any variables outside of their scope.
    Do not perform any I/O operations (like reading from disk, accessing the internet, or writing to the console).

Example 1 - pure

def multiply_by2(nums):
    products = []
    for num in nums:
        products.append(num*2)
    return products

Example 2 - impure

balance = 1000
cars = []

def buy_car(new_car):
    cars.append(new_car)
    balance -= 69

Example 3 - impure

import random

def roll_die(num_sides):
    return random.randint(1, num_sides)
