When not to use the nonlocal keyword: when the variable is mutable (such as a list, dictionary or set), and you are modifying its contents rather than reassigning the variable. You only need the nonlocal keyword if you are reassigning a variable instead of modifying its contents (which you must do to change immutable values such as strings and integers).
