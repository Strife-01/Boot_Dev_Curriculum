Recursion is often used in "tree-like" structures. For example:

    Nested dictionaries
    File systems
    HTML documents
    JSON objects

That's because trees can have unknown depth. It's hard to write a series of loops because you don't know how many levels deep the tree goes.

for entry_i in directory:
    if entry_i.is_dir:
        for entry_j in entry_i:
            if entry_j.is_dir:
                for entry_k in entry_j:
                    ...
