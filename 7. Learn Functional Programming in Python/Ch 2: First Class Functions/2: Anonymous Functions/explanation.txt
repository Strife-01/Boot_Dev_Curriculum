Anonymous functions have no name, and in Python, they're called lambda functions after lambda calculus. Here's a lambda function that takes a single argument x and returns the result of x + 1:

lambda x: x + 1

Notice that the expression x + 1 is returned automatically, no need for a return statement. And because functions are just values, we can assign the function to a variable named add_one:

add_one = lambda x: x + 1
print(add_one(2))
# 3

Lambda functions might look scary, but they're still just functions. Because they simply return the result of an expression, they're often used for small, simple evaluations. Here's an example that uses a lambda to get a value from a dictionary:

get_age = lambda name: {
    'lane': 29,
    'hunter': 69,
    'allan': 17
}.get(name, 'not found')
print(get_age('lane'))
# 29
