Admin Namespace

Let's add an "admin" namespace. This is where we'll put endpoints intended for internal administrative use. Note: there's nothing inherently more secure about this namespace, it's just an organizational structure.
Assignment

    Swap out the GET /api/metrics endpoint, which just returns plain text, for a GET /admin/metrics that returns HTML to be rendered in the browser. Use this template:

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, Chirpy Admin</h1>
    <p>Chirpy has been visited %d times!</p>
  </body>
</html>

Where %d is replaced with the number of times the page has been loaded.

    Make sure you use the Content-Type header to set the response type to text/html so that the browser knows how to render it.
    Try loading http://localhost:8080/admin/metrics in your browser, and in another tab load http://localhost:8080/app a few times. Refreshing the admin page should show the updated count.

    Update the POST /api/reset to POST /admin/reset. It's functionality should not change.

Run and submit the CLI tests.
