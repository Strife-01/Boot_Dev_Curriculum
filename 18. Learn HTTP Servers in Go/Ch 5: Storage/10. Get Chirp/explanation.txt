Now we need a way to lookup a single chirp by its ID. You might be thinking:

    "If I can get all of the chirps, why do I need a way to get just one?"

Imagine there are 10,000 chirps in the database - no, imagine 10,000,000,000! We'll obviously need to change our GET /api/chirps endpoint to only return a subset of chirps at a time.

However, our users will still need a way to view a single chirp - for example, maybe they have a link directly to it.
Assignment

    Add a GET /api/chirps/{chirpID} endpoint that returns a single chirp by its ID. The chirp ID will be passed in as a path parameter. For example:

GET /api/chirps/94b7e44c-3604-42e3-bef7-ebfcc3efff8f

You can get the string value of the path parameter like in Go with the http.Request.PathValue method.

    If the chirp is found, return it like so with a 200 code:

{
  "id": "94b7e44c-3604-42e3-bef7-ebfcc3efff8f",
  "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "body": "fr? no clowning?",
  "user_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}

    Otherwise, return a 404.
