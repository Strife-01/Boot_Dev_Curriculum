We need a way to retrieve all the chirps from the database. Later, we'll add sorting and filtering functionality, but you can think of this as a very basic version of an endpoint that might serve a timeline of chirps.
Assignment

    Add a new query that retrieves all chirps in ascending order by created_at.
    Add a GET /api/chirps endpoint that returns all chirps in the database. It should return them in the same structure as the POST /api/chirps endpoint, but as an array. Use a 200 status code for success. Order them by created_at in ascending order.
