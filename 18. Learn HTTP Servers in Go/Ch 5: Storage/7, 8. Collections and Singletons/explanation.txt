We're building a fairly RESTful API.

REST is a set of guidelines for how to build APIs. It's not a standard, but it's a set of conventions that many people follow. Not all back-end APIs are RESTful, but many are. As a back-end developer, you'll need to know how to build RESTful APIs.
Collections and Singletons

In REST, it's conventional to name all of your endpoints after the resource that they represent and for the name to be plural. That's why we use POST /api/chirps to create a new chirp instead of POST /api/chirp.

To get a collection of resources it's conventional to use a GET request to the plural name of the resource. So we are going to use GET /api/chirps to get all of the chirps.

To get a singleton, or a single instance of a resource, it's conventional to use a GET request to the plural name of the resource, followed by the ID of the resource. So we are going to use GET /api/chirps/94b7e44c-3604-42e3-bef7-ebfcc3efff8f to get the chirp with ID 94b7e44c-3604-42e3-bef7-ebfcc3efff8f.


GET /users/{id}
GET /users
