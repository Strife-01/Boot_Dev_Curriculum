A fileserver is a kind of simple web server that serves static files from the host machine. Fileservers are often used to serve static assets for a website, things like:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    Images


Steps

    Add the HTML code above to a file called index.html in the same root directory as your server
    Use the http.NewServeMux's .Handle() method to add a handler for the root path (/).
    Use a standard http.FileServer as the handler
    Use http.Dir to convert a filepath (in our case a dot: . which indicates the current directory) to a directory for the http.FileServer.
    Re-build and run your server
    Test your server by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser
