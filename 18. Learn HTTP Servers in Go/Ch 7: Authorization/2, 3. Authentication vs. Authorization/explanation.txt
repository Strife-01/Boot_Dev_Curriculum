Authentication vs. Authorization

As we covered briefly, authentication and authorization are two different things.
Authentication

Verify who a user is, typically by asking for a password, api key, or other credentials.
Authorization

Only allow a verified user to perform actions that they are allowed to perform. Sometimes it's based on exactly who they are, but often it's based on a role, like "admin" or "owner".
