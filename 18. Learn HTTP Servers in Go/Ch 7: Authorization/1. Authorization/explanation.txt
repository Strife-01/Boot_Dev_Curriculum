Authorization

While authentication is about verifying who a user is, authorization is about verifying what a user is allowed to do.

For example, a hypothetical YouTuber ThePrimeagen should be allowed to edit and delete the videos on his account, and everyone should be allowed to view them. Another absolutely-not-real YouTuber TEEJ should be able to view ThePrimeagen's videos, but not edit or delete them.

Authorization logic is just the code that enforces these kinds of rules.
Assignment

We already have a bit of authorization built into Chirpy: authenticated users can only create chirps for themselves, not for others.

    Add a PUT /api/users endpoint so that users can update their own (but not others') email and password. It requires:
        An access token in the header
        A new password and email in the request body
    Hash the password, then update the hashed password and the email for the authenticated user in the database. Respond with a 200 if everything is successful and the newly updated User resource (omitting the password of course).
    If the access token is malformed or missing, respond with a 401 status code.
