Making a GET Request in Go

There are two basic ways to make a Get request in Go.

    The simple but less powerful way: http.Get
    The verbose but more powerful way: http.Client, http.NewRequest, and http.Client.Do

If all you need to do is make a simple GET request to a URL, http.Get will work:

resp, err := http.Get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")

If you need to customize things like headers, cookies, or timeouts, you'll want to create a custom http.Client, and http.NewRequest, then use the client's Do method to execute it.

client := &http.Client{
	Timeout: time.Second * 10,
}

req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", nil)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

resp, err := client.Do(req)
