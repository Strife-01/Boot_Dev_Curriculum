You may encounter the PATCH method from time to time. It's frankly not used very often. It's meant to partially modify a resource, whereas PUT is meant to completely replace a resource.

PATCH is not as popular as PUT, and many servers, even if they allow partial updates, just use PUT.


PUT, PATCH
entire resources, a partial resource
