Security and Encryption

HTTPS requires that the client use SSL or TLS to protect requests and traffic by encrypting the information in the request. You don’t need to manually handle encryption or decryption—it's all done for you by the protocol. HTTPS is simply HTTP with built-in security!

HTTPS != Privacy

We won't cover how encryption works in this course, but it's important to understand what it does and doesn't do, at least in regards to HTTPS.

    HTTPS will encrypt the data in a request (like passwords, headers, body information, query parameters, etc). You and the recipient are the only ones who can read that information.
    HTTPS will not hide who you are or that you're communicating with the given server. If you don't want your wife who knows how to sniff network traffic to know you're using Boot.dev, HTTPS won't help.

HTTPS Verifies the Server

In addition to encrypting the information within a request, HTTPS uses digital signatures to prove that you're communicating with the server that you think you are. If a hacker were to intercept an HTTPS request by tapping into a network cable, they wouldn't be able to successfully pretend they are your bank's web server.
