jq is a powerful command-line tool for processing JSON data. Itâ€™s a favorite among developers for working with JSON because it can:

    Parse JSON: easily read and extract data from JSON responses.
    Manipulate JSON: modify JSON data on the fly.
    Filter JSON: find exactly what you're looking for within large JSON structures.
