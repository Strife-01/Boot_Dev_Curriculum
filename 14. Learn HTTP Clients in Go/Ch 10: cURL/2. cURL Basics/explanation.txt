The simplest cURL command makes a GET request to the provided URL, for example:

curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1

The response body is written to stdout

Because the output is written to stdout you can combine it with other commands, e.g. redirecting the output to a file.

curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 > user1.json

cURL supports a number of options and commands. Check their tutorial page or the man page for more information. We will only be covering the basics.

man curl
