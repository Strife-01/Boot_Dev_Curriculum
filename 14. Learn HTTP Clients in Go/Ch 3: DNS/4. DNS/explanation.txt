A "domain name" or "hostname" is just one portion of a URL. We'll get to the other parts of a URL later.

For example, the URL https://homestarrunner.com/toons has a hostname of homestarrunner.com. The https:// and /toons portions aren't part of the domain name -> IP address mapping that we've been talking about.
The net/url Package

The net/url package is part of Go's standard library. You can instantiate a URL struct using url.Parse:

parsedURL, err := url.Parse("https://homestarrunner.com/toons")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("error parsing url:", err)
	return
}
