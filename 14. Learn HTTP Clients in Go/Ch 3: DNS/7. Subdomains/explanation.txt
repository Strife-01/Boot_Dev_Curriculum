Subdomains

We learned about how a domain name resolves to an IP address, which is just a computer on a network - often the internet.

A subdomain prefixes a domain name, allowing a domain to route network traffic to many different servers and resources.

For example, the Boot.dev website that you're on right now is hosted on a different machine than our blog. Our blog, found at blog.boot.dev is hosted on our "blog" subdomain (and the IP address/computer it points to).
