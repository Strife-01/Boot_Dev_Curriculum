for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {
    // Loop Body
}

there is no for each in C - C doesn't have the iterator pattern - no iterables
for car in cars:
    print(car)


Parts of a for Loop

    Initialization
        Executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
        Is typically used to initialize the loop counter: int i = 0; for example
    Condition
        Checked before each iteration.
        If true, execute the body. If false, terminate the loop
        Often checks to ensure i is less than some value: i < 5; for example
    Final-expression
        Executed after each iteration of the loop body.
        Can be used to update the loop counter or run any other code: i++ for example
    Loop Body
        The block of code that is executed while the condition is true.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }
  return 0;
}

// Prints:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
