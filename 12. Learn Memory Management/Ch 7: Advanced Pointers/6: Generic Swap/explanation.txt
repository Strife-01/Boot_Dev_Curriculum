void swap(void *vp1, void *vp2, size_t size);

we will create a swap function that acts on any type of data 
because we need the size we will provide it

void *memcpy(void *destination, void* source, size_t size);

we will use memcpy that copies the data from source to destination and it copies exactly size bytes 
the function doesn't care about the data types underneeth the hood cause it copies binary directly into the memory space of the destination

we will interpret data later on by force casting the void pointer into a pointer that we need
