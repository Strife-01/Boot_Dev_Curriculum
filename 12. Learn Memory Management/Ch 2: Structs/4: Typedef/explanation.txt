struct Pastry {
    char *name;
    float weight;
};

turned into 

typedef struct Pastry {
    char *name;
    float weight;
} pastry_t;


pastry_t is just a convention for the declared types 
we start struct names with capital as convention for Object creators like Classes


typedef struct {
    char *name;
    float weight;
} pastry_t;

it is good to give the struct a name and to always use the typedeffed one because you might want to use the struct you created inside of it like a node for example
