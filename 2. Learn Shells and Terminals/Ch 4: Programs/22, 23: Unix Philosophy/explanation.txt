    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    Write programs to work together.
    Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.


    ls lists files and directories
    grep searches for text
    less displays text


grep "hello" some_file.txt | less


we handle data using text streams because they are text and we use a text line interface in the command line. easy to use
