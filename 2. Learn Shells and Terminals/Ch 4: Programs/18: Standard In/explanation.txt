stdin is the stream of data where programs read the input from
when we send an input to the computer this is places in the stdin where the programs read it from.

# execution stops until the user types
# something (in this case "Lane") and presses enter
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello,", name)
# Hello, Lane!
