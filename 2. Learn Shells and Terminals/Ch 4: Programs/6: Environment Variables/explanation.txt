an environment variable is a variable which is available for all the programs that the shell is running

env command will show you all the environment variables
export will create an environment variable 

export name=value

usually we have the name capitallizes by convention and the variables are ephemeral, they are not persistent after you stop the shell session unless they are in the config file
