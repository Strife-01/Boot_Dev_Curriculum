When you type a command like apt install neovim, the package manager will:

    Check to see if the package is already installed.
    If it's not installed, it will download the package from a repository.
    It will install the package on your computer.
    It will install any dependencies that the package needs to run.
    It will (hopefully) add the package to your PATH if it should be there.


which nvim
