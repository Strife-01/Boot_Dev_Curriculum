Pygame

Pygame is a module for developing games using Python. It provides simple functions and methods for us to easily draw images within a GUI window and handle user input.
Virtual Environment (venv)

Virtual environments are Python's way to keep dependencies (e.g. the pygame module) separate from other projects on our machine. For example, we need pygame version 2 for this project, but another project on your computer might require version 1.

As a best practice, each Python project on your machine should have its own virtual environment to keep them isolated from each other.


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

requirements.txt
pygame==2.6.1

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 -m pygame

the shebang needs to be the on in the environment directory in order to use the modules we install in the environment as they are locally installed in the env
