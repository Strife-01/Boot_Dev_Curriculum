We need collision detection. Now, this is a fairly deep topic, but we're going to keep things simple: we'll treat everything (including our triangular ship) as a circle when it comes to collisions.

Detecting a collision between two circles is simple:

    We calculate the distance between the center of the two circles, let's call it distance
    Let's call the radius of one circle r1, and the radius of the other circle r2
    If distance is less than or equal to r1 + r2, the circles are colliding. If not, they aren't.
