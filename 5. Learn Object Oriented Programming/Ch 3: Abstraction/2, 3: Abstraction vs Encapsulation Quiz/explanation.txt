Abstraction is about reducing complexity. Creating good abstractions is particularly crucial when you're developing libraries for other developers to use. For example, the built-in pow function in Python is an abstraction that hides the complexity of calculating exponents.

pow isn't magic. Somewhere, code that does something like this exists and is called when you use pow:

def pow(base, exponent):
    result = 1
    for _ in range(exponent):
        result *= base
    return result


abstraction is about making usage easier and encapsulation is about implementation complexity
