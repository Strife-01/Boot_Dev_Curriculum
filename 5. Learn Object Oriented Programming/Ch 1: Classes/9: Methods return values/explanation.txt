In oop we usually use procedures instead of functions because we use them to mutate the state of the object, ie the properties or fields etc.
They can also return if we want

class Soldier:
    armor = 2
    num_weapons = 2

    def get_speed(self):
        speed = 10
        speed -= self.armor
        speed -= self.num_weapons
        return speed

soldier_one = Soldier()
print(soldier_one.get_speed())
# prints "6"
