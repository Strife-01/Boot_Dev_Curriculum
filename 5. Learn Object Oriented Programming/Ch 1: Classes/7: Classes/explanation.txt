# Defines a new class called "Soldier"
class Soldier:
    health = 5
    armor = 3
    damage = 2


a class stores other values inside from metadata and state in fields and also functionality

a class defines a custom type
health = 50
# health is an instance of an integer type
aragorn = Soldier()
# aragorn is an instance of the Soldier type (class)

"Classes" are custom new types that we define as the programmer. Each new instance of a class is an "object".


class Archer:
    health = 40
    arrows = 10

# Create several instances of the Archer class
legolas = Archer()
bard = Archer()

# Print class properties
print(legolas.health) # 40
print(bard.arrows) # 10
