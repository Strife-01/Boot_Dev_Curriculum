Exit codes (sometimes called "return codes" or "status codes") are how programs communicate back whether they ran successfully or not.

the ? variable will hold the exit status
we use them to communicate the state of programs and if we have programs that are used in other programs we use them

code 0 success rest error

ls ~
echo $?
# 0

ls /does/not/exist
echo $?
# 1
