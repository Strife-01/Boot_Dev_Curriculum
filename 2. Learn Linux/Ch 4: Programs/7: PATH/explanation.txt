PATH environment variable knows where all your paths for executables are and when we try to run a command without a path, it looks it up in all the directories in the path or the files in it

you can set it with export PATH=$PATH"..."
or '...' but '' doesn't allow content substitution
the paths are separated by :

PATH='test'

add="add"

PATH=$PATH:$add

echo $PATH
