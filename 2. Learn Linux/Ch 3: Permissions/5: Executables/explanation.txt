Files with a .sh extension are shell scripts.
mydir/program.sh
./program.sh
we need the prefix for the shell script unless we have the path to the directory where it is located in the PATH environment variable

if we use chmod without a specifier for the target we will add or remove the permission for all of the u g o
unless we use the numbers
