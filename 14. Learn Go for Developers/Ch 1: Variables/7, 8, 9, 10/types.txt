go pearks:
  compiled - very fast compilation time

slower than other compiled languages
faster than non compiled languages

types:
int:
  int, int8, int16, int32, int64

uint:
  uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr

float:
  float32, float64

complex:
  complex64, complex128

truncation/ type casting in go we type cast with type(value)


defaults:
    bool
    string
    int
    uint
    byte
    rune
    float64
    complex128
stray from these only when you need every last bit of performance
