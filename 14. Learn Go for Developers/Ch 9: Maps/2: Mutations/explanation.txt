Insert an element
m[key] = elem

Get an element
elem = m[key]

Delete an element
delete(m, key)

Check if a key exists
elem, ok := m[key]

If key is in m, then ok is true and elem is the value as expected.
If key is not in the map, then ok is false and elem is the zero value for the map's element type.


maps are passed by reference to the functions exactly like slices
