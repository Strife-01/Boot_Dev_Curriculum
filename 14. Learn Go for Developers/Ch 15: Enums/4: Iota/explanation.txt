go has a feature that is called iota which is used with type aliasing and it is used like an enum in C

type sendingChannel = int

const (
    Email sendingChannel = iota
    SMS
    Phone
)

it creates a sequence of numbers from 0 onwards.

here Email = 0
SMS = 1
Phone = 2
etc

it is not an enum is a sequence of ints
