A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. This means that a pointer "points to" the location of where the data is stored NOT the actual data itself.


The * syntax defines a pointer:
var p *int


The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.
myString := "hello"
myStringPtr := &myString


* is also a dereference
& is a referenc

x := 5
y := x - this gets a copy of the value x
y := &x will get the address of x and *y will allow us to modify the x value but the address of y will still be a different value but the values is the address of the x
