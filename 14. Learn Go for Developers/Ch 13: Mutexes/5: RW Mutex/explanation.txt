the standard library also has sync.RWMutex

this is much more performant for reading as it posses the possibility to have:

RLock()
RUnlock()

in this case only one thread can have a Lock but there are as many as we need that can have a RLock as they can read

in RLock all of them can read
if we have Lock then we cannot RLock as we could get wrong values and only one thread can have access to this Lock at the same time

also if we have RLock writing is blocked
