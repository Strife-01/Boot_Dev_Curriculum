different directories (which in Go are different packages by definition)

Use Encapsulation from OOP: - expose data via API
package classifier

// ClassifyImage classifies images as "hotdog" or "not hotdog"
func ClassifyImage(image []byte) (imageType string) {
	if hasHotdogColors(image) && hasHotdogShape(image) {
		return "hotdog"
	} else {
		return "not hotdog"
	}
}

func hasHotdogShape(image []byte) bool {
	// internal logic that the application doesn't need to know about
	return true
}

func hasHotdogColors(image []byte) bool {
	// internal logic that the application doesn't need to know about
	return true
}

1. Hide internal logic
2. Don’t change APIs - keep the function signatures
3. Don’t export functions from the main package - A main package isn't a library, there's no need to export functions from it.
4. Packages shouldn't know about dependents - make packages generic
