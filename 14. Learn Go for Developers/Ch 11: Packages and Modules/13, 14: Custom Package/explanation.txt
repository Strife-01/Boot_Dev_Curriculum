in go only capitalized names are exported outside of our package, otherwise they are only visible in our package

if we go build and have no main function, go will still compile but it will cache the binary to the local build cache. Useful fo error checking

import "example.com/username/mystrings" we replace it with the path for the module we require it and the version
module example.com/username/hellogo

we import the module name if we want it whole

go 1.23.0

replace example.com/username/mystrings v0.0.0 => ../mystrings

require (
	example.com/username/mystrings v0.0.0
)
