Pointers are great for referencing and optimization.

python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

def update_coordinate_x(coord, new_x):
    coord.x = new_x

c = Coordinate(1, 2, 3)
print(c.x)  # 1
update_coordinate_x(c, 4)
print(c.x)  # 4


we get passing by value and passing by reference.

structs are passed by value
we need to pass them by reference if we want to change them
