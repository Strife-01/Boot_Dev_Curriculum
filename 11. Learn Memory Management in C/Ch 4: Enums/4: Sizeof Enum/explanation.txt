sizeof will work on enum

if the value of the enum exeeds the int, the compiler will use long or unsigned int to accomodate that value

  Enums are often used to represent the possibilities in a set. For example:

    SMALL = 0
    MEDIUM = 1
    LARGE = 2
    EXTRA_LARGE = 3


Remember that %zu is the format specifier for size_t
