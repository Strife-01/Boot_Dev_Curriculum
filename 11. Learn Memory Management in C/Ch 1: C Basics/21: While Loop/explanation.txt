    // Loop Body

the indefinite state Loop


Parts of a while Loop

    Condition
        Checked before each iteration.
        If true, execute the body. If false, terminate the loop
    Loop Body
        The block of code that is executed while condition is true.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
// Prints:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4


    The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop body.
    If the condition is false initially, the loop body will never even start.
    If the condition never becomes false, you will get an infinite loop.
