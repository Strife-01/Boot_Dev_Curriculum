The free function deallocates memory that was previously allocated by malloc, calloc, or realloc.

IMPORTANT: free does not change the value stored in the memory, and it doesn't even change the address stored in the pointer. Instead, it simply informs the Operating System that the memory can be used again.


forgetting to Free will fuck you in the not so long run you will run out of memory if you keep allocating and eventually you will fuck up.
