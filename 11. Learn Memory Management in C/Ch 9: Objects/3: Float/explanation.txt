So how do we store both floats and ints into the same type?

We're going to use the union and enum features in C to be able to do this, just like we discussed in previous chapters. You will need to extend the existing snek_object_kind_t and snek_object_data_t types to be able to include both ints and floats (and we will continue to add more types in the following chapters to exercise your newfound mastery of memory management).
