Multi-Column Indexes

Multi-column indexes are useful for the exact reason you might think - they speed up lookups that depend on multiple columns.
CREATE INDEX

CREATE INDEX first_name_last_name_age_idx
ON users (first_name, last_name, age);

A multi-column index is sorted by the first column first, the second column next, and so forth. A lookup on only the first column in a multi-column index gets almost all of the performance improvements that it would get from its own single-column index. However, lookups on only the second or third column will have very degraded performance.
Rule of Thumb

Unless you have specific reasons to do something special, only add multi-column indexes if you're doing frequent lookups on a specific combination of columns.
