The joke here is that if someone was using this query:

INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES (?);

And the "name" of a student was 'Robert'); DROP TABLE students;-- then the resulting SQL query would look like this:

INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--)

As you can see, this is actually 2 queries! The first one inserts "Robert" into the database, and the second one deletes the students table!
How Do We Protect Against SQL Injection?

You need to be aware of SQL injection attacks, but to be honest the solution these days is to simply use a modern SQL library that sanitizes SQL inputs. We don't often need to sanitize inputs by hand at the application level anymore.

For example, the Go standard library's SQL packages automatically protects your inputs against SQL attacks if you use it properly. In short, don't interpolate user input into raw strings yourself - make sure your database library has a way to sanitize inputs, and pass it those raw values.
