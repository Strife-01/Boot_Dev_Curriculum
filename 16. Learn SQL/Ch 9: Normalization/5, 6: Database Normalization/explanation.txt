Database normalization is a method for structuring your database schema in a way that helps:

    Improve data integrity
    Reduce data redundancy

What Is Data Integrity?

"Data integrity" refers to the accuracy and consistency of data. For example, if a user's age is stored in a database, rather than their birthday, that data becomes incorrect automatically with the passage of time.

It would be better to store a birthday and calculate the age as needed.
What Is Data Redundancy?

"Data redundancy" occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places. For example: saving the same file multiple times to different hard drives.

Data redundancy can be problematic, especially when data in one place is changed such that the data is no longer consistent across all copies of that data.


 
1st Normal Form:
  1. Every row must have a unique primary key
  2. There can be no nested tables

2nd Normal Form:
  1. 1st Normal Form
  2. All columns that are not part of the primary key must only be dependent on the entire primary key

3rd Normal Form:
  1. 2nd Normal Form
  2. All the columns not in the primary key are dependent only on the primary key

Boyce-Codd Normal Form
  1. 3rd Normal Form
  2. A column that is part of the primary key may not be dependent on a column that is not part of the primary key.
