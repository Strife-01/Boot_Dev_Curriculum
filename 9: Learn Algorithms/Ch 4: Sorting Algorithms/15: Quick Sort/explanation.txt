Divide:

    Select a pivot element that will preferably end up close to the center of the sorted pack
    Move everything onto the "greater than" or "less than" side of the pivot
    The pivot is now in its final position
    Recursively repeat the operation on both sides of the pivot

Conquer:

    The array is sorted after all elements have been through the pivot operation

Pseudocode

    Select a "pivot" element - We'll arbitrarily choose the last element in the list
    Move through all the elements in the list and swap them around until all the numbers less than the pivot are on the left, and the numbers greater than the pivot are on the right
    Move the pivot between the two sections where it belongs
    recursively repeat for both sections
