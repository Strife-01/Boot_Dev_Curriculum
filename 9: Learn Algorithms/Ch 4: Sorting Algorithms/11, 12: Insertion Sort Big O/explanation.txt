    Best case: If the data is pre-sorted, insertion sort becomes really fast. Can you see why?  O(n)
    Average case: The average case is O(n^2) because the inner loop will execute about half of the time.
    Worst case: If the data is in reverse order, it's still O(n^2) and the inner loop will execute every time.
