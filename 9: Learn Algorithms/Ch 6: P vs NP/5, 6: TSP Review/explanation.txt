 Solving TSP

def tsp(cities, paths, dist):
    perms = permutations(cities)
    for perm in perms:
        total_dist = 0
        for i in range(1, len(perm)):
            total_dist += paths[perm[i - 1]][perm[i]]
        if total_dist < dist:
            return True
    return False

Verifying TSP

def verify_tsp(paths, dist, actual_path):
	total = 0
	for i in range(len(actual_path)):
		if i != 0:
			total += paths[actual_path[i-1]][actual_path[i]]
	return total < dist

O(n!) and O(n)
NP
