Generally we try to avoid writing code that causes the usage of a resource to grow quadratically (with an exponent).

    Sometimes that's a lot of computations (CPU utilization / slowness).
    Sometimes that's a lot of memory usage (RAM utilization)
    Sometimes that's a large storage requirement (disk space)

A notable exception is in cryptography and security: we want to force attackers to waste resources trying to get at our information.

Factorial is even worse than exponential.
