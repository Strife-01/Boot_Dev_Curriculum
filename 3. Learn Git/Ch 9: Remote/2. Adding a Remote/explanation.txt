In git, another repo is called a "remote." The standard convention is that when you're treating the remote as the "authoritative source of truth" (such as GitHub) you would name it the "origin".

By "authoritative source of truth" we mean that it's the one you and your team treat as the "true" repo. It's the one that contains the most up-to-date version of the accepted code.
Command Syntax

git remote add <name> <uri>
git remote get-url origin
git pull origin main
