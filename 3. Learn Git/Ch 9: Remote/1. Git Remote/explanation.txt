This is where the "distributed" in "distributed version control system" comes from. We can have "remotes", which are just external repos with mostly the same Git history as our local repo.

When it comes to Git (the CLI tool), there really isn't a "central" repo. GitHub is just someone else's repo. Only by convention and convenience have we, as developers, started to use GitHub as a "source of truth" for our code.
