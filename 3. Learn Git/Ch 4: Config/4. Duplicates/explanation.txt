Typically, in a key/value store, like a Python dictionary, you aren't allowed to have duplicate keys. Strangely enough, Git doesn't care.
Unset All

The --unset-all flag is useful if you ever really want to purge all instances of a key from your configuration. Conversely, the --unset flag only works with a single instance of a key.

git config --unset-all example.key
