Fetching is nice, but most of the time we want the actual file changes from a remote repo, not just the metadata.
Command Syntax

git pull [<remote>/<branch>]

The [...] syntax means that the bracketed remote and branch are optional. If you execute git pull without anything specified it will pull your current branch from the remote repo.


Run git config pull.rebase false to make sure git will merge on a pull
