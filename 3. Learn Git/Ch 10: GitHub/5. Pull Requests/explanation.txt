    Switch to a new branch called add_classics off of main.
    Add another line to the classics.csv file:

Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock, 1960

    Stage and commit the change, and prefix the commit message with L:.
    Push the new branch to GitHub (push it to the remote add_classics branch).
    Navigate to the GitHub repo in your browser
    Click on the "Pull requests" tab near the top
    Click "New pull request".
    Set the base branch to main and the compare branch to add_classics, as we plan to merge add_classics into main later.
    Create the pull request, but don't merge it yet!
