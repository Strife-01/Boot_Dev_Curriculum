Git comes with a configuration both at the global and the repo (project) level. Most of the time, you'll just use the global config.


Assignment

Let's set your identity. Check if your user.name and user.email are already set:

git config --get user.name

git config --get user.email

If they aren't, set them. I recommend using your GitHub username and email.

git config --add --global user.name "github_username_here"
git config --add --global user.email "email@example.com"

Finally, let's set a default branch (we'll talk more about configs and branches later) so that we're all on the same page. Run:

git config --global init.defaultBranch master

    We're using master for now because it is Git's default, but later we'll change it to main, which is GitHub's default. Just bear with us for a second.

Make Sure It Worked

Your ~/.gitconfig file is the file that stores your global Git configuration. View it:

cat ~/.gitconfig
