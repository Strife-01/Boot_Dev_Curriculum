The git log command shows a history of the commits in a repository. This is what makes Git a version control system. You can see:

    Who made a commit
    When the commit was made
    What was changed


Each commit has a unique identifier called a "commit hash". This is a long string of characters that uniquely identifies the commit. Here's an example of mine:

5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f

For convenience, you can refer to any commit or change within Git by using the first 7 characters of its hash. For mine, that's 5ba786f.

Run the git log command. You should see your commit. Notice that git log (assuming the log is long enough) starts an interactive pager. You can scroll through the log with the arrow keys, and exit by pressing q.

Next, run git log again, but this time use the -n and --no-pager options to limit the maximum number of commits shown, and more importantly, to run it without the interactive pager. E.g.:

git --no-pager log -n 10
