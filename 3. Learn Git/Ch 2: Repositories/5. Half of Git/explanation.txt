Half of your workflow as a developer will just be 3 simple commands:

    git status
    git add
    git commit

It's most of what you need to work effectively as a solo developer. Another 40% of Git is about collaborating and storing your work on a remote server.

The last 10% is mostly about fixing mistakes, rolling back changes, and other advanced topics. Don't worry, we'll cover those, too.
