Now that we understand some of our plumbing equipment, let's get into the pipes. Here are some terms to know:

    tree: git's way of storing a directory
    blob: git's way of storing a file

Here's what I got when I inspected my last commit:

> git cat-file -p 5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f

tree 4e507fdc6d9044ccd8a4a3061324c9f711c4667d
author ThePrimeagen <the.primeagen@aol.com> 1705891256 -0700
committer ThePrimeagen <the.primeagen@aol.com> 1705891256 -0700

A: add contents.md



    Use git cat-file -p again, but this time with the hash of the tree object instead of the commit hash. You should see a blob object with its own hash.
    Use cat-file again to view the contents of the blob object.
    Run that same command, but this time redirect the output to a temporary file: /tmp/blobfile.txt.
