Let's say we start with this:

A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    vimchadsonly

And we merge vimchadsonly into main by running this while on main:

git merge vimchadsonly

The merge will:

    Find the "merge base" commit, or "best common ancestor" of the two branches. In this case, A.
    Replays the changes from main, starting from the best common ancestor, into a new commit.
    Replays the changes from vimchadsonly onto main, starting from the best common ancestor.
    Records the result as a new commit, in our case, F.
    F is special because it has two parents, C and E.

After:

A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        vimchadsonly

git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents
git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents
