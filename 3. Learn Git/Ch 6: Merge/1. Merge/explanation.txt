Let's say you're in a state where you have two branches, each with their own unique commits:

A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    other_branch

If you merge other_branch into main, Git combines both branches by creating a new commit that has both histories as parents. In the diagram below, F is a merge commit that has C and E as parents. F brings all the changes from D and E back into the main branch.

A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        other_branch

git log --oneline --graph --all
