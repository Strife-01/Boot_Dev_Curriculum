The simplest type of merge is a fast-forward merge. Let's say we start with this:

      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main

And we run this while on main:

git merge delete_vscode

Because delete_vscode has all the commits that main has, Git automatically does a fast-forward merge. It just moves the pointer of the "base" branch to the tip of the "feature" branch:

            delete_vscode
A - B - C   main



Notice that with a fast-forward merge, no merge commit is created.

This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of developers:

    Create a branch for a new change
    Make the change
    Merge the branch back into main (or whatever branch your team dubs the "default" branch)
    Remove the branch
    Repeat

git branch -d add_classics
