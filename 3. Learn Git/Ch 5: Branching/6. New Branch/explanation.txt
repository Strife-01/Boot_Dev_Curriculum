git branch my_new_branch

This creates a new branch called my_new_branch. The thing is, I rarely use this command because usually I want to create a branch and switch to it immediately. So I use this command instead:

git switch -c my_new_branch

The switch command allows you to switch branches, and the -c flag tells Git to create a new branch if it doesn't already exist.

When you create a new branch, it uses the current commit you are on as the branch base. For example, if you're on your main branch with 3 commits, A, B, and C, and then you run git switch -c my_new_branch, your new branch will look like this:
