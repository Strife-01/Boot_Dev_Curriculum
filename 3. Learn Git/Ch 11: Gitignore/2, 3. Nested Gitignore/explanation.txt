Your .gitignore file does not necessarily need to be at the root of your project.

It's fairly common to have multiple .gitignore files in different directories throughout a project. A nested .gitignore file only applies to the directory it's in and its subdirectories.

Let's say you have the following setup:

src/
├── assets/
│   ├── .gitignore
|   ├── cover_art.jpg
│   └── onlydevs.png
├── main.py
├── tests.py
├── venv/
│   └── bin/
|       ├── activate
│       └── python
.gitignore

Here are the contents of src/assets/.gitignore:

onlydevs.png
main.py

Here are the contents of the root .gitignore:

venv/bin/activate



src/assets/onlydevs.png
tests.py
