The very first step of any project is to create a repository. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a single project. You'll typically have one repository for each project you work on.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a project (other directories and files). The only difference is that it also contains a hidden .git directory. That hidden directory is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning information for the project.
