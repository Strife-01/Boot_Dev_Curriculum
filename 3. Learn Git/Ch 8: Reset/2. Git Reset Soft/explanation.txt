The git reset command can be used to undo the last commit(s) or any changes in the index (staged but not committed changes) and the worktree (unstaged and not committed changes).

git reset --soft COMMITHASH

The --soft option is useful if you just want to go back to a previous commit, but keep all of your changes. Committed changes will be uncommitted and staged, while uncommitted changes will remain staged or unstaged as before.
